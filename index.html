                I am currently a junior at Iowa State University majoring in computer engineering. I plan on getting 
                my bachelors and Masters in 5 years through Iowa States 5 year program. This semester Spring2024 I 
                am taking ComS319 and ComS309

                    I am in the university organization EWB(Engineers without borders) and was a part of the electrical team within the club.
                    The purpose of the club during my freshman year was to build a clinic in Ulloh Ghana for the less fortunate. As a part of
                    the electrical group, we were in charge of designing the electrical grid of the clinic. fans, outlets, lights etc. Within the 
                    electrical group, I was in charge of the lights. I did research on certain types of bulbs to use for effectiveness and costness.
                    Then I designed where the lights will go in each room and how much for each room, to provide to the electrical grid for the clinic.
                    This project provided an insight into a new skill because of to this point, I had done very little electrical work, and it showed
                    me the importance of working together in a group.
